# WebSockets and Socket.io

---

class: center, middle
# .center[What is the problem?]
We want to communicate the server with the client.

--

But wait, I want a real-time communication!

--

How I can do that?

----

## Reverse Ajax

Is a concept for sending data from the server to the client.

---

## How I can implement it?

Exists diffent Reverse Ajax communication techniques, among which:

--

* Comet
    - polling
    - streaming
    - long polling

---

## Comet

<img src="images/fig03.gif" alt="fig03.gif"/>

--

Comet is a web application model where a request is sent to the server and kept alive for a long time, until a time-out or a server
event occurs.

--

When the request is completed, another long-lived Ajax request is sent to wait for other server events.

---

## polling
<img src="images/fig01.gif" alt="fig01.gif"/>

--

The browser sends HTTP requests at regular intervals and immediately receives a response.

--

This is the first attempt to solution

--

Is good if we can synchronize the request interval for request to occur only when information is available on the server.

---

## polling

However, real-time data is often not that predictable :S

--

As a result we have unnecessary request, many connections are opened and closed needlessly in low-message-rate situations.

---

## Long-polling

--

The browser sends a request to the server and the server keeps the request open for a set period.

--

If a notification is received within that period, a response containing the message is sent to the client

--

Otherwise the server sends a response to terminate the open request.

--

when you have a high message volume, long-polling does not provide any substantial performance improvements over traditional polling.

---

## Streaming

--

The browser sends a complete request, but the server sends and maintains an open response that is continuously updated and
kept open indefinitely (or for a set period of time).

--

However, since streaming is still encapsulated in HTTP intervening firewalls and proxy servers may choose to buffer the response,
increasing the latency of the message delivery.

---

## Conclusions about the use of those methods

--

- Those methods try to simulate full-duplex communication over half-duplex HTTP

--

- Those methods are encapsulated in HTTP

--

- <p style="color:red"> Unnecessary header data and latency </p>

--

- Many soluctions use two connections: one for the downstream and one for the upstream.

--

- Introduces significant overhead and adds lots of complexity.

--

- <p style="color:red"> Half-duplex HTTP wasn't designed for real-time, full-duplex communication </p>

--

- Does not scale.

---

# .center[HTML5 Web Sockets to the Rescue!]

The HTML5 WebSockets specification defines an API that enables a full-duplex communication channel
between the user's browser and a server, that channel operates through a single TCP socket over the Web.

--

WebSocket represents the next evolutionary step in web communication compared to Comet and Ajax

--

The IETF standardised WebSockets in 2011

--

All major browsers began to roll out support for the standard

---

# Architecture
<img src="images/websocket-architecture.jpg" alt="websocket-architecture.jpg"/>

---

# Why it is better?
--

- Reduction in unnecessary network traffic and latency compared to the unscalable polling and long-polling

--

- <p style="color:red"> Web Sockets provides a true standard that you can use to build scalable, real-time web applications. </p>

--

- It provides a socket that is native to the browser

--

- It eliminates many of the problems Comet solutions are prone to

--

- <p style="color:red"> Web Sockets removes the overhead and dramatically reduces complexity. </p>

---

## How a WebSocket connection is established?

--

The client and server upgrade from the HTTP protocol to the WebSocket protocol during their initial <font color="red"> handshake </font>

---

## The WebSocket handshake

--

The client sends a WebSocket <font color="red"> handshake </font> request, then the server returns a WebSocket handshake response

--

```Javascript
// Cliente request

GET /text HTTP/1.1\r\n
Upgrade: WebSocket\r\n
Connection: Upgrade\r\n
Host: www.websocket.org\r\n
Sec-WebSocket-Key: x3JJHMbDL1EzLkh9GBhXDw==\r\n
Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: chat, superchat\r\n
Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13\r\n
Origin: http://example.com\r\n


// Server response
HTTP/1.1 101 WebSocket Protocol Handshake\r\n
Upgrade: WebSocket\r\n
Connection: Upgrade\r\n
Sec-WebSocket-Accept: HSmrc0sMlYUkAGmm5OPpG2HaGWk=\r\n
Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: chat\r\n
```

---

## The WebSocket handshake

The handshake resembles HTTP so that servers can handle HTTP connections as well as WebSocket connections on the same port.

--

<font color="blue"> (from client request) </font> Sec-WebSocket-Key contains base64-encoded random bytes

--

<font color="blue"> (from server response) </font> Sec-WebSocket-Accept contains a hash of the key.

--

It is just to prevent caching, buffering proxy.

--

Once established, WebSocket data frames can be sent full-duplex, in either direction at the same time.

--

The data is minimally framed with just two bytes.

---

# what about Socket.io?

--

- Socket.IO is an event-based bi-directional communication layer for realtime web applications, built atop Engine.IO

--

- It abstracts many transports, including AJAX long-polling and WebSockets, into a single API

--

- It allows developers to send and receive data without worrying about cross-browser compatibility.

---

## First Major Release

- Socket.IO finally reached version 1.0 on the 28th of May, 2014

--

- The Socket.IO project contained two parts before 1.0: a transport handling implementation
and a high-level API

--

- Transport handling has been moved out into a separate, framework-agnostic project: Engine.IO

---

# Engine.IO

The main premise of Engine, and the core of its existence, is the ability to swap transports on the fly.
A connection starts as xhr-polling, but it can switch to WebSocket.

--

Engine.io abstracts the differents transport mechanisms.
